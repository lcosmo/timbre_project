$S_Desc_strategicplanning='Strategic planning: legal requirements, regional/urban land use plans as well as the interests of local government, zoning boards, planning agencies and environmental regulatory agencies are identified in order to ensure that all the plans requisites and restrictions are respected and to foster the success of the rehabilitation process. In this contest the identification and involvement of the relevant stakeholders is a key point since it ensures that their needs, visions for the area and interests are properly analysed and taken into consideration.';
$S_Desc_investigation='Investigation (preliminary/detailed): determination of site characteristics and definition of the extent and magnitude of contamination at a site.<br />Preliminary investigation concerns the identification of potential contamination according to information on of site history (i.e. maps, plans, photographs, geological and hydrological data, past owners/occupiers, industrial or commercial uses, raw materials, disposal of waste and any mining activities) and available sampling data.<br />Detailed investigation focuses on confirming whether any contamination exists at a site, locating any contamination, characterizing the nature and extent of that contamination as well as defining the conceptual model of the site. It is essential to perform an appropriately detailed study of the site in order to identify the cause, nature, and extent of contamination and the possible threats to the environment or to any people living or working nearby.';
$S_Desc_riskAssessment='Risk assessment (qualitative/quantitative): qualitative risk assessment allows to quickly identify potential risks, as well as assets and resources which are vulnerable to these risks. Qualitative risk assessment deals with the comparison of contaminant concentrations measured in soil, water or soil gas at a site with generic assessment criteria. Generic assessment criteria are typically conservative to ensure that they are applicable to the majority of sites and normally apply to only a limited number of pollutant linkages.<br />Quantitative risk assessment makes greater use of site-specific data to conduct a more accurate assessment of risks. Quantitative/detailed risk assessment involves the use of models to derive site-specific assessment criteria that are then compared with measured concentrations in soil, water or soil gas at the site to estimate risk.';
$S_Desc_remediationStrat='Remediation strategies and options: review and analysis of clean up alternatives. It is propaedeutic to the “Remediation technologies selection” because it aims to collect available information on possible strategies and options including the capability to meet specific clean up and redevelopment objectives, in accordance with legal requirements and regional/local planning and development goals.';
$S_Desc_remediationTech='Remediation technologies evaluation and selection:  permits to evaluate various technologies in order to identify those technologies with the capability to meet specific clean-up and redevelopment objectives taking into account also the economic aspects (i.e. the most suitable remediation technologies for the specific site according to a specific budget). The review, analysis and selection of clean-up alternatives relies on the data collected during the site assessment, the investigation phases and the cost-benefit analysis.';
$S_Desc_buildingAndInfr='Building and infrastructure documents: collection of documents for building planning, drawings and specifications needed to obtain building permits and to support the BF rehabilitation. These documents are used for tendering and to ensure that buildings are safe, healthy, accessible and sustainable from the environmental point of view.';
$S_Desc_deconstruction='Deconstruction/re-use of structures materials: deconstruction is the process of selectively and systematically disassembling buildings that would otherwise be demolished to generate a supply of materials suitable for reuse in the construction or rehabilitation of other structures.';
$S_Desc_wasteManagement='Waste management: the collection, transport, processing or disposal, managing and monitoring of waste materials, mostly produced during the deconstruction of structures.';
$S_Desc_requalificationPlan='Requalification plan development: definition of a remediation technologies plan, which focuses on the application clean-up technologies to prepare the property for redevelopment and reuse. The design of the requalification plan and its implementation requires close coordination with all stakeholders.';
$S_Desc_ImplementationControlMon='Implementation, control, monitoring (land back to market): guarantee that the selected interventions are properly implemented, monitored and enforced in order to ensure the long-term durability, reliability and effectiveness of the interventions.';
$S_Desc_SocioeconomicAss='Socio-economic assessment: the socio-economic assessment aims at identifying the possible economic (business) implications of different alternatives for requalification of the site.';
$S_Desc_FundingAndFinancing='Funding and financing: the organization responsible for the remediation process has to consider several strategies in order to provide funding and financial support to all the other processes and phases.';
$S_Desc_Decisionmaking='Decision-making and communication: decision making is the process of evaluating and ranking different scenarios (i.e., suitable solutions for the rehabilitation of contaminated sites) on the basis of different criteria such as for example future land uses, socioeconomic benefits, remediation costs, time span, environmental impacts, technology set/s (including train technologies) and residual risk. These aspects are usually evaluated by means of suitable indices.';
